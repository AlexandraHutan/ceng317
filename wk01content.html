  <p>
   <ol>
	<li>Schedule for today: Introduction, Homework (choose a project/group and fill in an Excel table for your individual proposal).</li>
    <li>Start off by logging into a computer. Please visit the blackboard site.</li>
	<li>Regarding computer issues please report them to ITS via Ali_dot_Owayid_at_humber_dot_ca and cc me to bring downed computers to our attention for repair.</li>
    <li>Welcome to your IoT themed hardware projects.</li>
	<li>Blackboard (Riipen/six0four).</li>
	<li>Introduction via Bikeshare Example.
	 <ul>Computer Engineering Technology example project of a bicycle rental service:
      <li>There was a time that one would go to a bicycle rental company's
		  shack, provide something of value as a deposit and the person working
	  	  at the shack would provide a bicycle on the understanding that you
		  would return it along with payment for the amount of time that you
		  used it in exchange for return of your deposit.   </li>
		  <img src="https://www.torontoisland.com/images/bike/IMG_1697.JPG">
	  <li>Times have changed, now you use your smart phone to provide your
		  credit card information to the bicycle rental company and then you are
		  provided the code to unlock a bicycle and you are charged based on
		  when you next lock it up.	   </li>
		  <img src="https://humber.ca/staff/sites/default/files/sub-images/dropbike%20lake%20and%20north.jpg">
	  <li>The Computer Engineering Technology capstone consists of creating
		  project similar to this. In this example there is a lock mechanism, a
		  set of buttons to enter a code, lights and sound to provide feedback.
		  In CENG 317, for this example, the group lead (student A) might use a 
		  Broadcom development platform to make the hub with lights and sound, 
		  student B might build an I2C lock mechanism and student C would build 
		  a I2C code entry interface. In CENG 319,
		  students A, B and C would form a group to write the corresponding app.
		  In CENG 355, the group would package everything up together as a
		  functioning prototype.   </li>

	<li>Discussion of group members (stm32f103c8t6).<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/ceng317/master/images/stm32f103c8t6.jpg"></li>
	<li>In CENG 319 Software Project, students will work in groups to create an Android Application that can connect to a database.</li>
    <li>In CENG 317 Hardware Production Technology, students will work individually to prepare working hardware (an I2C circuit board) that can connect to a database for a sensor or effector type relevant to their Android application.</li>
    <li>In CENG 355 Computer Systems Project students work in groups to integrate their mobile application with their sensors and effectors to create an IoT system that for which both it and its application can independently
	 connect to the same database. (The mobile application may, in addition, also connect directly via bluetooth to the IoT device.)

	<li>The maximum size of your project is in alignment with the space below the tray in your Humber North Campus Electronics Parts kit, you are expected to bring both your project and parts kit along with safety glasses every week otherwise there is a minimum one mark deduction on the week's submission.</li>
	<li>Each student will decide on a sensor or effector.</li>

      <li class="task-list-item">Choose your own to be approved that fits the CENG 317 Hardware Production Technology requirements:<ol>
	  <li>Each project will have a 3rd party mentor/advisor/industry partner that will meet with the group on campus in person at the beginning, middle and end of each term (fall and winter).</li>
	  <li>The industry partner should be from a company that has been in operation for at least two years with at least two full time employees.</li>
	  <li>Each group will be 3 students, a lead and 2 additional students.</li>
	  <li>For CENG 355 the section you attend, are registered in, and are a group member in, must match. (Winter term)</li>
	  <li>For CENG 319 the section you attend, are registered in, and are a group member in, must match. (Fall term)</li>
	  <li>For CENG 317 each student will individually design a PCB and connect a sensor or effector unit related to their project to it. (Fall term)</li>
	  <li>A custom I2C PCB with a six pin stackable header will be designed for each sensor/effector connecting to a Broadcom microprocessor development platform.</li>
	  <li>A custom I2C or other serial, bluetooth, or other RF; PCB will be designed for each sensor/effector connecting to a microcontroller development platform.</li>
	  <li>Overall project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x 7.25cm) which represents the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/cen317/master/images/week1projectbox.jpg">space</a> below the tray in the parts kit.</li>
	  <li>The highest AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.</li>
      <li>We work with prototypes and prototypes are not to be left powered unattended.</li>
      <li>The Raspberry Pi (that you purchase) is a Broadcom development platform that was chosen for a number of reasons.<ul>
       <li>Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C.</li>
       <li>TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however boot times and resources are not as good.</li>
       <li>The Motorola/Freescale/NXP/Qualcomm HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost.</li>
       <li>Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straightforward.</li>
       <li>That said, the Raspberry Pi can be the hub and other platforms can be incorporated to create the spokes.</li>
