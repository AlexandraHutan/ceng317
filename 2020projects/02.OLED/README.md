# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info
     1. Name: 
     2. Date: 
     3. Section:
     4. Sensor/Effector choice: OLED
2. I will make a USB serial device that will (choose: send output from a sensor, or, receive input for an effector) via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). This can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. They can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term.
