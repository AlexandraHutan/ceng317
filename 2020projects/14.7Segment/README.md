# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info: Name, Date, Section, Sensor/Effector choice.
2. I will make USB serial device that will (choose: send output from a sensor, or, receive input for an effector) via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). Thia can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. They can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term.
