# CENG 317 Proposal
1. Basic info:
    1. Name: 
	2. Date: 
	3. Section:
	4: Sensor/Effector choice: PCF8574
2. I will make USB serial device that will send output from a sensor (switch) and receive input for an effector (two LEDs) via [Seeed Studio assembly](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html). Thia can be connected via a USB cable to a PC and PuTTY can be used for debugging. They can then also be connected to a Pi via USB but not necessarily this term. 
3. Preliminary Bill of Materials
    1. OPL: [ShenZhen](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html)
    2. MPN: PCF8574T
	3. Qty: 1

    4. Description:	
	5. Manufacturer: HGSEMI
	6: Package: SOP-16
4. Specifications
    1. What does it sense/effect?
	2. How accurate is it?
    3. Voltage range:
	4. Current draw:
	5. Protocol:
	6. Additional components needed: Beginning STM32 Figure 11-9 two LEDs, resistors, switch
