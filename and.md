# Smart Home Monitor

<h2> Week Eight </h2>

<p> This week the Breadboard milestone was due. Using the raspberry Pi and HC-SR501 sensor, I managed to write a C program using the wiring Pi Libaray to detect motion and turn on an LED when motion was detected. Overall the milestone was sucessfully met on time, Financially I am on track <p>
