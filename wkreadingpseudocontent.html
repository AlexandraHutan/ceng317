  <H3>Reading Week Hardware Study Day - no class</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>Consider whether you have:
 	<li>Ordered your parts and blogged about it - if it wasn't a study day then it would have been the milestone of bringing your parts to class.</li>
	<li>Breadboarded your circuit to test your sensor with the development platform and use fritzing to record your work.</li>
 	<li>Blinked an LED on a crib Pi <a href="https://six0four.github.io/StudentSenseHat/cribpi.html">getting started https://six0four.github.io/StudentSenseHat/cribpi.html</a>.</li>

  <H3>PSEUDO CODE ASSIGNMENT</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>This is a cross semester assignment with assigned groups as per your blackboard message:
    <li>In third year students build a project. First year students will work with them to create pseudo code relevant to their project.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>Computer Engineering Technology example project of a bicycle rental service
    <li>There was a time that one would go to a bicycle rental company's
		shack, provide something of value as a deposit and the person working
		at the shack would provide a bicycle on the understanding that you
		would return it along with payment for the amount of time that you
		used it in exchange for return of your deposit.</li>
	<li>Times have changed, now you use your smart phone to provide your
		credit card information to the bicycle rental company and then you are
		provided the code to unlock a bicycle and you are charged based on
		when you next lock it up.</li>
	<li>The Computer Engineering Technology capstone consists of creating
		project similar to this. In this example there is a lock mechanism, a
		set of buttons to enter a code, lights and sound to provide feedback.
		In CENG 317, for this example, student A would build an I2C lock
		mechanism, student B would build a I2C code entry interface, student C
		would build a lights and sound I2C feedback device. In CENG 319,
		students A, B and C would form a group to write the corresponding app.
		In CENG 355, the group would package everything up together as a
		functioning prototype.</li>
	<li>This semester, each CENG 317 student will be paired up with one or two
		TECH 104 students for help with pseudo code. These groups are assigned
		and the pseudo code is due October 16th, 2018 via blackboard. You are
		provided each other's email addresses via a blackboard message and you
		need to arrange to meet outside of class time - the prototype lab
		(J233) is a great place to meet. This is a 5% peer graded assignment
		and the third year student should specify what I2C device they have
		chosen and help one first year student write pseudo code to write data
		from the I2C device to a cloud service/write data from a cloud service
		to the I2C device. The third year student should help the second
		student write device specific pseudo code for the app to read data
		from a cloud service/write data to the cloud service from the app.</li>
	<li>Each student will peer grade their other group members contribution
		with the third year students providing information about the project
		and the first year students writing the respective pseudo code. The
		submissions will be
		individual and be a single sided sheet of letter size pdf including
		their grading of their peers. The resulting grades may be shifted for
		a class average of 4/5 please use the following as a guideline:
	 <ul>
	  <li>Proficient 5</li>
	  <li>Competent 4</li>
	  <li>Basic 3</li>
	  <li>Needs Improvement 2</li>
	  <li>NA 1 (e.g. you met the student but code was not written)</li>
	 </ul>
	</li>
	<li>First TECH104 Student: Provide the firmware pseudo code and grade the CENG317 student, example:
	 <ul>setup{
	  <li>Specify sensor's I2C address</li>
	  <li>Specify data base credentials</li>
	</ul>}
	<ul>loop{
	  <li>Read the sensor</li>
	  <li>Insert into data base</li>
	</ul>}
	<li>Second TECH104 Student: Provide the pseudo code for android activities to display data from database and grade the CENG317 student, example:
	 <ul>setup{
	  <li>Show intro screen</li>
	  <li>Enter credentials</li>
	</ul>}
	<ul>loop{
	  <li>Query database</li>
	  <li>Display data</li>
	</ul>}
	 <li>3rd year CENG Student: Provide System UML diagram and grade pseudo code of first and second TECH104 students.</li>
	</li>
