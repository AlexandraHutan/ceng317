  <H3>Week 8 Hardware</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>
	<li>This week is the power-up milestone which will be peer graded (<a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/Week7PeerGradingRubricforPCB.xml">rubric</a>).</li>
	<li>Next week the placard (one per group) is due, post a link to your group's submission on your blog (<a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/Week8AnalyticRubricforPlacard.xml">rubric</a>). A <a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/DRAFTMulticolourPlaque.pub">template</a> is available.</li>
	<li>Next week the 30 Second Script is due, this is to help you explain what you have accomplished while demo'ing it for the camera.</li>
	<li>It turns outs that the newest version of Rasbian has realvnc-vnc-server installed by default which conflicts with xrdp. Instead of installing xrdp on your development platform you can install <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/">VNC Viewer</a> on your desktop to connect instead of using Remote Desktop Connection. The boot options still need to be set along with ensuring VNC (and I2C) is enabled via Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces and such an image is in the dropbox as before. Please let me know if you have had success purging realvnc-vnc-server and installing then using xrdp.
