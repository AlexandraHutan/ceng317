  <H3>Week 9 Hardware (A - Monday Nov. 6, B - Friday Nov. 3)</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>
	<li>This week the placard (one per group) is due.</li>
	<li>This week the individual 30 second script is due.</li>
	<li>There was an <a href="http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html">OpenSCAD</a> demonstration, a laser cutting explanation using Eagle, as well as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Movie_Maker#2017">MovieMaker</a> demonstration. Alternative: <a href="https://www.blender.org/manual/editors/sequencer/strips/types/effects/speed_control.html?highlight=video%20sequence%20editor">Blender</a>.</li>
	<li>Next week the 30 second build video is due. It should be a concatenation of:<ul>
	 <li>a 2 second opening title screen with the project and student name,</li>
     <li>a few seconds of the parts that arrived,</li>
     <li>a few seconds of the parts assembly,</li>
     <li>a few seconds of the power up; and,</li>
     <li>a few seconds about the functionality you plan to demonstrate at the open house.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>The open house demonstration will take place in J202. We will have to reconfigure the room (<a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/Week10J202OpenHouse.vsdx">floorplan</a>) and note that some of the power outlets do not work so not all of you will have power. Let me know your table choice next week.</li>
